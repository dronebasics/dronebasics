					<p class="mdl-card__supporting-text">Ever since there have been things to deliver, humans have been coming up with new, innovative ways of delivering items. First there was the most basic – walking. Then came horses, trains, cars, and even airplanes. Each has gradually replaced the other, but none has managed to completely replace its predecessor. So what comes next? Logically, the best thing that could be done would be an easily-made, cheaper, and faster version of the best we have; namely, the airplanes. And that’s exactly what a drone is. It can go wherever it needs to go very quickly, carrying what it needs to. And because of its size, it neither costs very much to manufacture nor is it excessively valuable, so it’s not of utmost importance to make it with the strongest possible materials.</p>

Many retailers in an area will all get their supply from a single warehouse, meaning that if that warehouse isn’t as efficient as it can possibly be, many stores, and therefore their customers, will suffer. As a result, it makes sense to remove any human error with drones in the warehouses. They remove labor costs, speed up the workflow, and, perhaps most importantly, allow for the specialization of labor. Why pay one person to do 3 jobs when you can make 1 drone for each, while saving money in the long run?</p>

It has always cost a lot to dust crops, from renting some form of aircraft to actually decontaminating the crops. Drones, however, make both steps easier. Instead of having to transport a bulky drone from person to person based on who has rented it most recently, farmers can have a single, multi-purpose drone that helps with crop dusting and can be reused. It saves them energy and time, both of which result in profit, so it pays off in the long run.</p>
